# howmuchblur
A visual background blur calculator

howmuchblur.com was a website I developed, that was online for a few years and provided a convenient tool to compare the bokeh and background blur of different camera's and lenses. The source code for this website can now be found in this repository. 

I am not affiliated with the current owners of howmuchblur.com. That website is also based on my code. However, their way of thanking me for that was a DCMA takedown request for this GitHub repository, which failed for obvious reasons.

ONLINE VERSION

Thanks to Gijs de Koning the code is hosted online at: http://howmuchblur.dekoning.nl
